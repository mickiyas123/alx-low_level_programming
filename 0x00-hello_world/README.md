# 0x00. C - Hello, World

Going over the resources and tasks i was able to understand this concepts

    Why C programming is awesome
    Who invented C
    Who Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan  and Linus Torvalds are
    What happens when you type gcc main.c
    What an entry point is
    What main is
    How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
    How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
    How to compile using gcc
    What the default program name  is when compiling with gcc 
    What the official C coding style is and how to check your code with betty-style
    How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
    How does the main function influence the return value of the program


# Tasks
* **0-preprocessor**
     * [0-preprocessor](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) Bash script that runs a C file that saved in the variable $CFILE through the preprocessor and save the result in the file c

* **1-compiler**
     * [1-compiler](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) Bash script that compiles a C file name that will be saved in the variable $CFILE but does not link, output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c

* **2-assembler**
     * [2-assembler](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code that will be saved in the variable $CFILE and save the output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

* **3-name**
     * [3-name](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name) Bash script that generates the assembly code of a C code that will be file name will be saved in the variable $CFILEand save it in an output file

* **4-puts.c**
     * [4-puts.c](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line

* **5-printf.c**
     * [5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line

* **6-size.c**
     * [6-size.c](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on
     Example: Size of a char: 1 byte(s)
              Size of an int: 4 byte(s)
              Size of a long int: 8 byte(s)
              Size of a long long int: 8 byte(s)

* **100-intel**
     * [100-intel](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file

* **101-quote.c**
     * [101-quote.c](https://github.com/mickiyas123/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) A C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error
