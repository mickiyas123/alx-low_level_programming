# Alx low level programming & Algorithm  - Data structures and Algorithms, Linux and Unix system programming 

## Desription 

This repository contains code written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program provided by Holberton School. i spend more than 3 mounths learning about key concepts of data structure and algrothims(Array, Linked list, Stack, Queues,Tree, Heap, Hash Table,Graph...) using C with a ton of challenging exercises to practice which helped me understnad the concepts even more.
